My name is Matthew Huang. My Wake Tech Email is mhuang1@my.waketech.edu.

This is my my Wake Tech GitHub account. This repository will hold assignments for my CTI-110 class I'm taking in the Summer 2025 term. I'm looking forward to this class!

# About Me
## My Interests

I'm very interested in various AI topics, such as computer vision and pathfinding.

I also like reading books, soccer, and piano.

At Wake Tech, in addition to CTI 110, I'm taking various other classes, such as CSC 120. I'm also taking classes in Business Administration, where I'm hoping to learn about how businesses are manged and how different problems are handled.

## Websites I Recommend

- [TED-Ed](https://ed.ted.com/): TED Talks were mentioned in the example guide, but TED-Ed is another great resource by ted that has lots of great videos on different topics, such as:
    - Riddles: TED-Ed has lots of great math and logic puzzles that are really run.
    - Science: TED-Ed also has videos in very interesting science topics, such as zombie fires, self healing concrete, and much more!
- [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/0/) has lots of great built-in themes, and can automatically set up layouts for you. I use it in all my presentations and it's a great tool.
