        <h1>My name is Matthew.</h1>
        <p>
            I'm a student at Wake Tech Community College. I'm in high school and in the CCP program, currently on the Computer Programming Foundations pathway. I'm currently taking CTI-110: Web, Programming, and Database Foundations. 
            <br>
            I like learning about AI. I'm interested in both newer ML techniques (such as those used to create ChatGPT), but I also do a lot of work with "traditional" AI techniques such as pathfinding.
            <br>
            In my free time, I like to play soccer, play piano, and read. I'm on a FIRST Tech Challenge robotics team, and a Science Olympiad team.
